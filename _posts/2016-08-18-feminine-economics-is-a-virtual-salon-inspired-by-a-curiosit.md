Feminine Economics is a virtual salon inspired by a curiosity to explore how our economic systems can serve us better.

It is time for a deep questioning of the inftrastructure that our lives are built around -- that includes economic systems, philosophical systems, political systems, and spiritual.

Feminine Economics aims to explore the overlap of all these systems:

• How can we bring back the Generalist's perspective to our specialized economy?

• How can we create conversations that explore the overlap in our culture?

• How can we assimilate the big-picture view into our business culture so that we can help each other thrive? Is capitalism as we know it sustainable? Or is our survival (economic, environmental, and social) dependent on a new system to replace it?
