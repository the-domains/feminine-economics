We are all in this beautiful, tragic, broken, magical world together; we -- men, women, blacks, whites, liberals and conservatives -- we all have the right to be heard. Feminine Economics is based on this premise that in order to create solutions to the world's problems we must talk to each other, listen, and understand each other -- we must co-llabor-ate. Through collaboration we will be able to compete in the future game of survival.

As a woman bumping my way through the masculinized business world, I have learned a plethora of lessons about not only my role in the big picture, but also other women's role, men's role, and most importantly the role of the feminine -- not gender-based femininity, but principal-based femininity - in our society.

This blog was created to incite dialogue with other men and women who are curious about what the future of business could look like. Through collaboration, I believe we can co-create a place where we all can thrive. This is the key principal of femininity : It understands that in order for the "whole" to thrive, all individual parts must thrive.

What is Feminine Economics?

Feminine Economics is a place to dialogue. It's an invitation to like-minded men and women to join a conversation about our current competitive economic system, its inherent demise, and how we can move towards a balanced, more feminine society to avert that demise.

So what does a healthier balanced "more feminine society" look like?

"feminine" principles are represented by:

* cooperation
* emotional intelligence
* collaboration
* compassion
* consensus-seeking
* adaptability
* nurturing
* intuition
* vulnerability
* we vs I
* wisdom

I believe that by integrating feminine principles (collaboration) into our current masculine (competitiion) economic culture we can shift our fate.

How do we integrate "feminine" principles into our business and working environments?

How do we integrate "feminine" principles into the _very_ fabric of our cultural infrastructure?

I invite anyone who stumbles upon this blog to engage and to share your ideas.

Here are the topics I'm particularly passionate about:

* Does a "feminine" business imply it's run by women?
* Nurture Capital
* Soil Economy
* The Danger of Scalability
* Regenerative Economy
* The Future of Capitalism
* B Corporations
* Masculine Women
* Feminizing our Men

In order to integrate the feminine into the current masculine system, we need to be willing to deeply understand today's masculine paradigm. To understand, we must find compassion for the women and men - yes, our beloved brothers and fathers and friends, many of whom are left out of the conversation because, well, they're "men." How exclusive is that? Isn't this the very behavior that we as women have despised over the years?   
Yes, for us to embrace our true feminine, we must hold a space for the men who are doing their best to navigate the shifts as well. And, we must find compassion even for those who are most afraid of change: The Establishment. The Old Boy's Network. Big Brother. Wall Street.

So, what am I saying? Have compassion for the Dick Cheneys of the world?

Yes.

That is divine femininity.

Perhaps it's time to really_listen_ to the "other side's" fears, and work with them to assuage those fears. The Establishment's biggest fear is most likely based on loss of money and hence, power. So let's help them address their biggest fear. Let's help them gently along to trust the emergence of a balanced, more feminine culture, by using our innate feminine, nurturing, compassionate, inclusive, loving and collaborative qualities.
